# Photography Website (Collections → Projects → Photos)

**Deploy**
1) Put all these files at the repo root.  
2) GitHub Pages → Settings → Pages → Source = “Deploy from a branch” → Branch: `main`, Folder: `/(root)`.  
3) Visit: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/

**Add your images**
- Create folders like `images/automotive/gt3rs/` and export two sizes per photo: `*-sm.jpg` (~800px) and `*-lg.jpg` (~2000px).
- Replace Unsplash URLs in `data.js` with your paths (e.g., `images/automotive/gt3rs/01-sm.jpg`).
- Tip: add an empty `.gitkeep` file in new folders so git tracks them.
